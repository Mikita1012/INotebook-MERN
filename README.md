# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- App.js (or Your Main Application Component):

This is the root component of your application.
It wraps the entire application or the relevant parts with the NotesState context provider.
It contains routes or other high level logic.

NotesState (Context Provider):
This component provides the NotesContext.
It manages the notes state and the addNote, editNote, and deleteNote functions.
It wraps the Notes component, making the context values available to all its descendants.

Notes:
This component acts as a container for the AddANote and NotesList components.
It ensures that both components are rendered on the same page.
It handles the layout and organization of these components.

AddANote:
This component provides the form to add new notes.
It uses the addNote function from the NotesContext to add notes.

NotesList:
This component receives the notes array from the NotesContext.
It maps over the notes array and renders a NoteItem component for each note.
It is responsible for displaying the list of notes.

NoteItem:
This component represents a single note item.
It receives the note data as props.
It displays the note's title, description, and other relevant information.
It also contains the delete and edit icons. -->
